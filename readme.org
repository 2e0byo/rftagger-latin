#+title: RFTagger for Latin

This repo contains code to get [[https://www.cis.lmu.de/~schmid/tools/RFTagger][RFTagger]] working with Latin.  It uses the model from [[https://github.com/Alatius/latin-macronizer][latin-macronizer]].

* Usage

  You need RFTagger installed.  On Linux you can likely just fetch the source
  code and drop the precompiled binaries in ~RFTagger/bin/~ somewhere in your
  ~$PATH~.

  Then you can either use the parfile in this repo (which may be out of date),
  or run the `gen_parfile.sh` to get the latest from the latin macronizer
  project.


  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./gen_parfile.sh
Cloning into 'latin-macronizer'...

  #+END_SRc

* Credits
  Please note that the parfile is from latin macronizer.  I've literally just
  written a few lines of bash.
